# xml Files for Producing CORSIKA Samples on Fermigrid

**Note:** The xml files contained here will not run "out of the box." They are currently configured for a specific user (i.e., the one writing this right now) and will need to be modified for new users. They are shown here for documentation purposes, particularly to show which fcl files, tar balls, and memory requests were used to produce the input CORSIKA samples used for this analysis.
